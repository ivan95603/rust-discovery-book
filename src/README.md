# `Discovery`

Discover the world of microcontrollers through [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)!

There are currently three versions of this book. All of them provide an introduction to microcontrollers and how to use Rust with them. 
Unless you need to work with a micro:bit v1 or an STM32F3 discovery board, it is *strongly* recommended that you use the latest book.

- [Read the latest book, using a micro:bit v2](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/discovery-mb2/)
- [Read the older book, using a micro:bit v1 or v2](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/discovery/microbit)
- [Read the oldest book, using an F3 discovery board](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/discovery/f3discovery)
- Start working on the examples from this repository
- You've got questions?
    - Have a look at our [discussions section on
      GitHub](https://github.com/rust-embedded/discovery/discussions)
    - Maybe it has already been answered
    - If not, start a new discussion
- You've found an issue?
    - Have a look at our [issues on
      GitHub](https://github.com/rust-embedded/discovery/issues)
    - Maybe there is already a workaround
    - If not, please open a new one - or even better - a [pull
      request](https://github.com/rust-embedded/discovery/pulls) for solving
      it
- Have fun and enjoy!
